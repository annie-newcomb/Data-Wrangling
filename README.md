# Data-Wrangling
A project from Udacity where I use various methods to gather data from Twitter and combine and fix the data. 

This contains several files, including:
* a jupyter notebook with python code showing how I gathered the data and what I subsequently did with it. 
* the four data sets 
* two pdfs explaining methodology and process
